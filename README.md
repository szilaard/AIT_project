# Music genre classification based on audio
Czumbel Péter, Horváth Szilárd



Our goal is to implement a deep learning model to classify music based on genre. The goal of music genre classification is to accurately predict the genre of a given piece of music. Deep learning methods can be used to automatically learn features and patterns in audio data to improve the accuracy of genre classification.

You can run the project on colab. If you do so you will need a kaggle api key. You can get it if you log into kaggle and open your profile and under the account tab you can create a new token.
